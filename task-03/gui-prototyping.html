        </h1>
        <h3>Low-Fidality prototype</h3>
        <p>
            This prototype is inteded to work on a touch device, so the buttons (plant selection, Excel file selection, Excel file columns) are <br/>
            designed quite a bit larger.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the top area we have a selection for each plant. When the user clicks on a specific plant, all collected excel files will be loaded <br/>
            to the excel file selection view on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the lower right section is the plant data displayed. The columns are selectable. When the user selects a colum, the chart in the middle <br/>
            of the window will adapt to its selected data type.
        </p>
