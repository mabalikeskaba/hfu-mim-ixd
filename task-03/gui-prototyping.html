        <h3>Low-Fidality prototype</h3>
        <div class="task-content">
            <p>
                This prototype is inteded to work on a touch device, so the buttons (plant selection, Excel file selection, Excel file columns) are <br/>
                designed quite a bit larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the top area we have a selection for each plant. When the user clicks on a specific plant, all collected excel files will be loaded <br/>
                to the excel file selection view on the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the lower right section is the plant data displayed. The columns are selectable. When the user selects a colum, the chart in the middle <br/>
                of the window will adapt to its selected data type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking on the gears icon in the upper right corner brings you to the settings view
            </p>

                In the chart view you can manage your charts which will be displayed in the main view
            </p>
            <p>
                You can add new charts, as well as modify and deleted existing ones.
